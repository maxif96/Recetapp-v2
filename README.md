That is the home page, nice right?

This project is about upload cooking recipes.

## What you can do in this page?
- **Upload recipes** - A little obvious. You can upload your favorite recipes, as well as edit or delete them.
- **Upload photos** - You can upload photos you have taken to your recipes
