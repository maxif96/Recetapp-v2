That is the home page, nice right?

This project is about cooking recipes.

## What I can do in this page?

- **Create an user** - You can have a profile with a picture of you and your data, you can also update or delete it.
- **Upload recipes** - A bit obvious. You can upload your favorite recipes, as well as edit or delete them.
- **Upload photos** - You can upload photos you have taken to your recipes
- **Comment recipes from others** - You can comment (and upload or delete those comments) and score from 1 to 5 stars (forks in this case)
- **You will safe** - Your recipes and your account are protected with Spring Security, only you can delete or edit your profile, recipe or comments.

## How can I access to the web-page locally?

You must have installed a management database system like MySQL and an IDE or some enviroment which run Spring projects.
Then, create the database which must be called 'recetappdb' in this case.
Next, you can run the project with Maven.
Once done it, you will access to the following url: http//localhost:8080 

That's all
